# NixOS Configuration Progress

## What Works

The following components have been successfully implemented:

1. **Repository Structure**
   - ✅ Modular directory structure
   - ✅ Separation of concerns (hosts, modules, home)
   - ✅ Templates for new hosts and users

2. **Configuration Modules**
   - ✅ System modules (boot, network, users, etc.)
   - ✅ Service modules (SSH, Docker, Tailscale, Ollama)
   - ✅ Desktop modules (KDE)

3. **Host Configuration**
   - ✅ Host-specific configuration for nixos-desk
   - ✅ Hardware configuration integration

4. **Home Manager**
   - ✅ User configuration for 'ham'
   - ✅ Integration with flake.nix

5. **Documentation**
   - ✅ README with usage instructions
   - ✅ Memory bank for project context
   - ✅ Detailed plan for Surface Pro 7 configuration

## What's Left to Build

The following components still need to be implemented or improved:

1. **Surface Pro 7 Configuration**
   - ✅ Create nixos-surface host configuration
   - ✅ Integrate nixos-hardware for Surface-specific optimizations
   - ⏳ Configure touchscreen and other hardware support
   - ✅ Set up remote building with nixos-desk
   - ⏳ Resolve WiFi connectivity issues when upgrading to unstable branch

2. **Remote Building Setup**
   - ✅ Configure SSH keys for passwordless authentication
   - ✅ Set up trusted users on nixos-desk
   - ✅ Create modular remote-builder configuration
   - ✅ Add troubleshooting tools and documentation
   - ⏳ Test distributed builds

3. **Testing**
   - ⏳ Test the new configuration structure
   - ⏳ Verify that all services work as expected
   - ⏳ Test multi-machine setup

4. **Additional Hosts**
   - ⏳ Add configurations for other machines as needed
   - ⏳ Test synchronization between machines

5. **Advanced Features**
   - ⏳ Secrets management
   - ⏳ Deployment automation
   - ⏳ Backup and recovery procedures

6. **Refinement**
   - ⏳ Optimize module structure based on usage
   - ⏳ Add more specialized modules as needed
   - ⏳ Improve documentation with examples

## Current Status

The repository has been successfully reorganized according to best practices for NixOS flakes with multiple hosts. The structure is now modular, making it easy to add new machines and share common configurations.

The current implementation includes:
- Working configurations for nixos-desk and nixos-surface
- Modular system, service, and desktop configurations
- Home Manager integration for user 'ham'
- Templates for adding new hosts and users
- Comprehensive documentation
- A dedicated remote-builder module for distributed builds
- Surface Pro 7 configuration with nixos-hardware integration
- SSH key setup for secure remote building

The Surface Pro 7 configuration has been implemented with remote building capabilities, using nixos-desk as the remote builder. The next steps include testing the distributed builds and finalizing the Surface-specific hardware configurations.

## Known Issues

The following issues are currently known:

1. **Untested Changes**
   - The reorganized structure has not been fully tested
   - Some services may require additional configuration

2. **Potential Duplication**
   - Some packages are defined in both system packages and home-manager
   - This may lead to duplication but ensures availability in both contexts

3. **Documentation Gaps**
   - More detailed examples would be helpful
   - Troubleshooting section could be expanded

4. **Future Compatibility**
   - The configuration uses nixos-unstable, which may introduce breaking changes
   - Regular updates and testing will be needed

5. **Hardware-Specific Challenges**
   - Surface devices may require specific kernel parameters or patches
   - The nixos-hardware module provides basic support, but additional tweaking may be needed
   - **WiFi Connectivity Issue**: When upgrading the Surface Pro 7 to the unstable branch, WiFi connectivity is lost from KDE
   - A detailed plan has been created to address the WiFi connectivity issue (see memory-bank/surface-wifi-fix-plan.md)

6. **Remote Building Considerations**
   - SSH key authentication must be properly set up
   - The remote builder must be available on the network
   - Firewall rules must allow SSH connections
   - The Surface-specific SSH key must have correct permissions (600)
